## Boosting Algorithm

Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines set of weak learners into a strong learner. The main idea behind boosting is to train predictors sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor. 
This process of aggregating sevaral small problems to create a strong model is what we do in boosting.

Boosting algoritms are primarly used in machine learning to reduce bias and variance. The work by repeatedly combining a set of weak learners to create strong learners that can make accurate predictions.

Here's how the Boosting algorithm works:
1. Initialize the dataset and assign equal weights to each data points.
2. Provide this as input to the model and identify the wrongly classified data points.
3. Increase the weight of wrongly classified data points.
4. If the required results are obtained, end the process. otherwise go back to step 2.

There are many boosting methods available, but the most popular ones are ***AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)*** and ***Gradient Boosting***. For example, AdaBoost works by paying more attention to the training 
instances than the predecessor has incorrectly classified.

Boosting has several advantages:
- *Improve Accuracy* : Boosting can improve the accuracy of the model by combining several weak model's accuracies.
- *Better handling of imbalanced dataset* : Boosting can handle imbalance data by forcing more on the data points that are misclassified.
- *Better Interpretability* : Boosting can increase the interpretability of the model by breaking the model decision process into multiple processes.
