## What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for *predicting continious values*.
- ***It finds a straight line that best fits the data points you provide***.
- This line represents the relationship between one or more independant variables (X) and dependant variable (Y).
- The algorithm minimizes the distance between the data points and the fitted line to achieve the best fit.
- This allows you to use the equation of the fitted line to predict Y for new unseen X values.
